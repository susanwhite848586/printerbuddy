        <title>Codehost Partners With Objectif Lune</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectif-lune-and-codehost-inc-partner-to-expand-printing-choices-for-linux-marketplace&quot;&gt;Objectif Lune and Codehost Inc. Partner to Expand Printing Choices for Linux Marketplace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Montreal, Quebec and Culver City, CA - February 22, 2005&lt;/b&gt; — Objectif Lune, a leader in solutions for the efficient design and high-volume printing of transactional forms and variable content documents, today announced a cooperative partnership with Codehost, Inc. to address the printing needs of the emerging Linux marketplace. Codehost is the leading provider of Linux and Unix printing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated Unix printing has been a cumbersome chore for years, and Linux printing has also been very complex without many options. With Linux coming to the mainstream, the need for sophisticated print support in these environments is greater than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the two companies are actively collaborating to allow Objectif Lune PlanetPress software and the BrightQ printing suite from Codehost to talk directly to each other using standard shipset features. As a result, Linux environments gain a higher level of built-in functionality and flexibility without requiring users to manage communications between the two applications or deploy special versions of the software. PlanetPress can be used to automatically generate variable content-based documents and transactional forms for output, so Linux users can easily and instantly select a document or a form template for printing, eliminating time and steps in document workflow, while increasing output versatility and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our vision is to support the full network environment with integrated document solutions. Linux is an area that is relatively new to the printing industry, but it should not be penalized with limited printing options,” said Objectif Lune CEO, Didier Gombert. “Our collaboration will help bring variable printing to the Linux and Unix world and give users the opportunity to more easily leverage variable printing as a business communication strategy for both the transactional and promotional world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are working together to maximize the benefits of our document solutions to best serve the ever-changing environments of our customers and the needs of our OEM partners,” said Sam Bizri, President &amp;amp; CEO, Codehost, Inc. “The easier we make Linux to use and demo to customers, the quicker printer vendors will be able to capitalize on this growing opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codehost’s BrightQ printing suite is considered the de-facto Unix and Linux printing standard for the multi-function copier segment. BrightQ has been adopted by leading printing manufacturers to better serve their Unix and Linux clients, and it has helped vendors increase unit sales and network connectivity, while dramatically reducing Unix and Linux support costs for printing. As a desktop or server solution, BrightQ Pro saves service and support staff hours of time, while giving the end-user complete access to their printer’s output options. The added value of PlanetPress automation for variable content documents and transactional forms will further increase productivity gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PlanetPress suite of products from Objectif Lune enables sophisticated, conditional printing of text and graphics in an open architectural environment without modifications to host software. PlanetPress allows customers to offload heavy print stream traffic from enterprise networks and seamlessly divert it to laser printers for faster workflow. Companies achieve greater productivity from their existing processes, while gaining the ability to easily and quickly produce their critical printed business documents. Customers can dispense with costly, pre-printed forms; create high visual quality documents, automate high-volume production; simultaneously deliver electronic formats or fax; and create optimized searchable archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As Linux operating systems continue to gain market share and momentum, we are working together to ensure an integrated, user-friendly printing solution,” said Mr. Bizri. “The strong compatibility and synergy between our two companies will allow us to maximize the benefit of our technological innovations to serve the evolving needs of our customers and OEM partners.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two companies also share strong relationships with leaders in digital printing technology, further increasing the value of the partnership. “We will be working together in the future on bringing other important solutions to the market. This partnership will allow us to increase the pace of our innovative document technologies and boost our leadership in the industry,” concluded Mr. Gombert.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BrightQ 1.6.5 Available</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CULVER CITY, CA November 10, 2003&lt;/b&gt; — Codehost Inc. has announced the availability of the 1.6.5 upgrade to BrightQ. It is highly recommended that those using BrightQ 1.6.4 or earlier versions, upgrade to this newest release. BrightQ 1.6.5 contains a number of product enhancements across all platforms that dramatically improve overall product performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those running BrightQ in the System V (or lp) printing environments will greatly benefit from 1.6.5, as a number of back-end changes have been made to optimize the product’s performance and reliability on these systems. The System V printing architecture is most commonly associated with the Sun Solaris, Hewlett-Packard HP-UX, AIX and SCO supported 
UNIX operating environments. When upgrading, version 1.6.5 can be installed directly over 
an existing 1.6.4 version of BrightQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This upgrade affects all current OEM partners who are using BrightQ as their enterprise Linux and UNIX printing solution. Downloads and upgrades can be found at each OEMs respective download site:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Codehost Releases BrightQ 1.6.4</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-latest-version-of-codehosts-unix-and-linux-printing-suite-includes-advanced-features-and-support-for-additional-unix-operating-systems&quot;&gt;The latest version of Codehost’s UNIX and Linux printing suite includes advanced features and support for additional UNIX operating systems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CULVER CITY, CA&lt;/b&gt; — Codehost Inc. announced today the 
availability of the 1.6.4 version of the BrightQ printing suite. The latest 
release of this cohesive printer driver package for the UNIX and Linux operating 
systems includes additional feature functionality and support for two additional 
versions of UNIX running on the x86 platform; Solaris 8 and FreeBSD (version 4.6 
and above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We feel that providing support for these popular versions of UNIX gives our 
printer OEM partners a greater market reach for their devices, while addressing 
the growing need for robust UNIX printing solutions,” said Codehost CEO, Sam 
Bizri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BrightQ printing suite provides an easy-to-use printing interface driving 
multi-function devices and high-end workgroup printers. BrightQ gives users 
access to all available printer finishing features for a number of versions of 
UNIX and distributions of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New features of the product are highlighted by an advanced license activation 
manager and full command line interface support. Codehost’s proprietary license 
activation manager gives users of BrightQ the capacity to upgrade feature 
functionality and add support for additional devices without having to replace 
the core software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all of BrightQ’s advanced features can now be accessed through the 
command line interface within UNIX and Linux environments. This includes command 
line access to BrightInstall (Codehost’s UNIX and Linux installation tool), the 
BrightQ configuration tool for setting up printers and print queues, and the 
product registration module. Having full command line access to BrightQ provides 
support to those environments not running X windows and an alternative to users 
who prefer printing without an interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Linux World in August, Codehost announced the availability of BrightQ for 
Codehost’s most recent multi-function and workgroup printer partner, Kyocera 
Mita. BrightQ (Linux and UNIX printer driver) downloads for Kyocera Mita can be 
found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kyoceramita.codehost.com&quot;&gt;
kyoceramita.codehost.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional OEM downloads of BrightQ downloads and documentation, as well as 
information on Linux and UNIX printing can be found at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codehost.com&quot;&gt;www.codehost.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-codehost-inc&quot;&gt;About Codehost Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1999, Codehost has emerged as the leader in Linux and UNIX software

        <title>Codehost Announces Support For FreeBSD</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;codehost-makes-the-brightq-printing-solution-for-multi-function-devices-and-printers-available-for-the-freebsd-operating-environment&quot;&gt;Codehost makes the BrightQ™ printing solution for multi-function devices and printers available for the FreeBSD operating environment.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CULVER CITY, CA - MAY 14, 2003&lt;/b&gt; — Codehost Inc., a leading provider of software solutions for hardware manufacturers within the printing and imaging markets, today announced that it’s BrightQ™ printing suite will support the FreeBSD operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrightQ™ provides administrators and users of various flavors of Unix, Linux, and now FreeBSD, with an easy-to-use, graphically-rich, printing environment, and easy-to-configure and support service protocol suite.  The turnkey package allows end users to take full advantage of a multi-function devices or a printers advanced finishing capabilities, while still capitalizing on the strengths of their mission critical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While FreeBSD may not yet have the recognition of other free Unix operating systems, it is being utilized within countless [corporate] IT environments as a backbone for everyday IT solutions,” said Sam Bizri, president and CEO of Codehost. “In releasing BrightQ for FreeBSD, we’re doing our part by providing professional printing tools for serious operating systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD is an advanced operating system that supports a number of hardware architectures including x86 and UltraSPARC. It is derived from BSD Unix and offers advanced networking, performance, security and compatibility features which are unavailable in some commercial operating environments. Like Linux, FreeBSD and its source code, are free of licensing costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a FreeBSD user, I’m more than happy to assist in releasing the necessary printing tools to a robust Unix operating system like FreeBSD. BrightQ’s cross-platform nature allows us to supply this printing solution between a robust Unix OS and high-end printing equipment,” said Rafael A. Barrero, a senior sytems engineer at Codehost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrightQ™, in addition to providing full feature support to the FreeBSD printing environment, will also provide a turnkey print driver interface, support for industry standard printing protocols, and a queuing system that is simple, intuitive, and cohesive across Unix operating systems and Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrightQ™ offers support for most major UNIX operating systems and Linux distributions. The BrightQ FreeBSD release will support FreeBSD 4.0 and above. Codehost distributes its product through its OEM partners and their dealer channels. Companies currently offering BrightQ include Canon, Ricoh, Savin, Lanier, Gestettner and Kyocera Mita.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kyocera Mita Partners With Codehost</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;codehosts-brightq-printing-tools-available-for-kyocera-mita-printers-and-multi-functional-products-mfps&quot;&gt;Codehost’s BrightQ Printing Tools available for Kyocera Mita Printers and Multi-Functional Products (MFPs)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fairfield, New Jersey and Culver City, California - April 8, 2003 —&lt;/b&gt; Kyocera Mita, one of the world’s leading document imaging companies, and Codehost, Inc., a leading provider of software solutions for original equipment manufacturers within the printing and imaging markets, today announced a strategic alliance to distribute BrightQ software through dealers/resellers to customers who currently utilize a Linux or Unix environment for their printing projects.  BrightQ’s suite of Linux and Unix printing utilities has demonstrated perfect interoperability with Kyocera Mita’s ECOSYS printers and multi-functional products (MFPs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kyocera Mita is pleased to announce this strategic partnership with Codehost and its BrightQ printing application,” said Michael Pietrunti, vice president, marketing for Kyocera Mita.  “BrightQ is easy to setup and provides Kyocera Mita customers with a user friendly interface.  In addition, by partnering with Codehost, we’re not only extending our reach into the Linux and Unix printer market, but we’re also providing our dealer and reseller channels with additional value when selling the devices.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed for Unix and Linux operating systems, BrightQ™ gives administrators and users an easy-to-use printing environment. Not only does BrightQ™ provide a simple, graphical printing environment, but also allows users to take advantage of the full functionality of their high-end printers.  BrightQ™ is geared specifically to provide original equipment manufacturers and value added resellers with a solution that provides their Unix and Linux customers with a highly intuitive and robust printing solution.  This dynamic printing suite is customizable for nearly any line of consumer, industrial or back-office printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Kyocera Mita printers and its advantages, Till Kamppeter, Maintainer of Linuxprinting.org said, “I recommend Kyocera Mita’s printers because they offer several advantages, including the permanent drum unit. With the permanent drum unit in all Kyocera Mita laser printers the user just needs to replace the toner and not the drum and toner together which reduces the per-page costs substantially. In addition, Kyocera Mita has cooperated nicely with the free software community, and so their printers work perfectly with Linux and Unix.”&lt;/p&gt;

the flexibility and intuitiveness of a memo pad in an electronic medical record, 
and offers time savings through real-time transcription and transcription 
approval.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Codehost Licenses CUPS From EasySW</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;codehost-to-include-portions-of-cups-source-for-use-with-brightq-printing-suite&quot;&gt;Codehost to include portions of CUPS source for use with BrightQ™ Printing Suite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CULVER CITY, CA and HOLLYWOOD, MD - January 16, 2003 &lt;/b&gt;— Software developers Codehost, Inc. and Easy Software Products announced today that the two companies have entered into a licensing agreement that will allow Codehost to utilize aspects of the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) source code. The CUPS source code will be used within BrightQ™, Codehost’s popular turnkey printing suite for corporate UNIX and Linux users of multi-function devices and high-end printers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the inclusion of CUPS source code, Codehost is capitalizing on what is emerging as an industry standard in Linux and UNIX print systems.   While we have included some CUPS code in our product, BrightQ™ still retains its ability to function with or without CUPS acting as the default print system,” said Eric Levy, Codehost’s General Manager of printing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Codehost has merged components of the CUPS technology with the advanced installation, print queue management, and sophisticated vendor centric filters, and parsers of the BrightQ™ printing suite. This allows Codehost to further protect its OEM partner’s investments while increasing the scalability and interoperability of BrightQ™.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having access to the Easy Software development team’s deep knowledge of UNIX and Linux printing allows us to grow to meet both technical and market demands,” said Codehost CEO Sam Bizri. “In the long term, this relationship will enable us to channel the appropriate resources as we extend our products and services to include undeveloped and untapped areas of corporate printing and imaging solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-codehost-inc&quot;&gt;About Codehost Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1999, Codehost has emerged as the leader in Linux and UNIX software development for printers and multi-function devices, providing solutions and services for top manufacturers such as Canon U.S.A and Samsung Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an expertise in a number of operating system platforms, hardware architectures, embedded technologies and peripheral devices, Codehost strives to establish long-term relationships with OEMs to support and grow their market share, while helping them enter emerging market segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrightQ™ was chosen as a finalist for the Best Desktop Office Solution award during the LinuxWorld 2002 in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Canon And Codehost Announce Partnership</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;canon-usa-and-codehost-inc-announce-development-agreement-to-offer-brightq-for-the-imagerunner&quot;&gt;CANON U.S.A. AND CODEHOST INC. ANNOUNCE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT TO OFFER BRIGHTQ FOR THE imageRUNNER&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAKE SUCCESS, NY and CULVER CITY, CA - August 13, 2002&lt;/strong&gt; — Canon U.S.A., Inc., a subsidiary of Canon Inc. (NYSE: CAJ), and industry leader in networked imaging solutions, and Codehost Inc., a leader in Linux and Unix software applications, today announced a development agreement where Codehost will supply its BrightQ™ suite of Linux and Unix-based printing tools for use with Canon’s imageRUNNER line of multi-function devices.  The two companies will demonstrate the solution this week at LinuxWorld 2002, being held in San Francisco’s Moscone Center August 13-15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Canon U.S.A. is very pleased to announce this new development agreement with Codehost,” said Dennis Amorosano, director and assistant general manager of Canon U.S.A.’s Copier and Networked Office Systems Division.  “With BrightQ, our dealers and customers will have complete Linux and Unix print support for our popular line of imageRUNNER devices, including access to the advanced document finishing features that have clearly differentiated us from our competition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Canon is demonstrating that both complex printing and finishing features need not be the sole realm of Microsoft and Apple clients.  This step will enable a MFD market that up to this point has been almost completely ignored and subsequently untapped,” said Eric Levy, general manager of Print Systems at Codehost Inc. “The Linux operating system continues to make inroads into corporate infrastructure, and on the desktop. We envision this trend continuing.  The nature of not having to manage costly client OS licenses, and the ever increasing volume of available software will continue to push Linux onto the desktop, where complex printing will be the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BrightQ™, in addition to providing Linux and Unix printing to Canon’s imageRUNNER line, will also provide a turnkey print driver interface, support for industry standard printing protocols, and a queuing system that is simple, intuitive, as well as cohesive across Unix operating systems and Linux distributions. Other key components of BrightQ™ include Codehost’s BrightInstall, an installation tool that enables systems support personnel to easily install, configure, and support their Unix/Linux customer base, BrightQ™ configuration tool, and the BrightQ™ Print Job Manager.  BrightQ™ offers support for most major UNIX operating systems and Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
